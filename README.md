# Project-Mortgage-Loan

You have decided to purchase a beautiful brownstone home in the $800,000 range. While you do have a considerable amount of cash on hand, you don't have enough to purchase the entire home outright, which means you will have to take the remaining balance out as a mortgage loan. From the sound of it, you'll have to put about 20% down up-front to a mortgage loan of that size.

This up-front payment is known as a down payment.

You have been given a 30-year mortgage loan quote for your desired amount at 3.75%. The value of the mortgage loan is available as mortgage_loan

Due to the size of the mortgage loan, you begin the mortgage in the initial period by paying mostly interest and retaining very little principal, or equity that goes towards the ownership of your home.

This means that if you were to stop paying your mortgage and sell your home after only a few years, the bank would actually own most of the home because what you paid was mostly interest, and very little principal.


Every time a mortgage payment is made, the following payment will have a slightly lower percentage, which is used to pay off interest. This means that more of the remainder will go towards the portion of the home that you own instead of the bank. This is important to determine how much you will gain from selling the home before paying off your mortgage, or to determine when your mortgage is underwater.
